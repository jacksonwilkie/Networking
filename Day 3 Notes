Active, passive, internal, external

Passive External:
Job listings, web recon, whois listings, DNS Queries, Google searches, Shodan, Zone Transfers

Active External: 
Nmap scans, ping scans

Passive Internal:
Open ports, running services, other users logged in the box, ARP Cache, Interface IPs, Known routes, Packet Sniffers
/etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf

Active Internal:
Ping Sweep/ARP Requests

Passive reconnaissance
    Gathering information about targets without direct interaction
    Not as straight forward and requires more time than active reconnaissance
    Lower risk of discovery

Passive External Network Reconnaissance
    Information gathered outside of the network using passive methods
    Allows for more efficient attacks and plans

    Scanning Approach

        Aim
            Wide range target scan
            Target specific scan
        Method
            Single source scan
            Distributed scan

nmap -A -T4 --min-rate 10000 -Pn <target host/network> -vvvv
cat /etc/hosts
cat /etc/resolv.conf
ss -ntulp : open ports
ps -elf Running serveses and procs
who/w other users logged in 
ip neigh for arp cache
ip route for known routes
ip r
